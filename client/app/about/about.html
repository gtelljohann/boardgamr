<p>Welcome to Board Gamr!  If you're like me, sometimes you want to try a new board game, or maybe you want to try to figure out what game would be the best one to introduce to a friend, or maybe you need a way to figure out the best game to play with a certain group of people.</p>  
<p><i>Enter Board Gamr.</i></p>  
<p>Select some games you know you and your friends like, and click "Recommend" to get a couple of suggestions based on their shared mechanics and themes.  If you know you especially like one of those mechanics or themes, select it to give it more weight in the recommendation.</p>
<p>Since it's sometimes hard to know what games to recommend, for now I've limited the selection to games I know, either through playing them myself or through their appearance on Geek & Sundry's show, <a href="http://geekandsundry.com/shows/tabletop" target="_blank">TableTop.</a></p>
<p>Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find this to be a useful tool for all your board game indecision!</p>
